Lets say Iâ€™m really interested in SpaceX.
I first login,
then I create a topic
then I find an article or tweet, or any sort of news
I add the article title, date, url, and summary
I save it
Inside my SpaceX topic I can then see a history of articles in linear fashion
I can scroll through the topic and see all articles
I can click on article and it takes me to the article page with the summary and opens the article
